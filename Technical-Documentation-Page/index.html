    <p>Java is a programming language created by James Gosling from Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1991. The target of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating systems. The first publicly available version of Java (Java 1.0) was released in 1995. Sun Microsystems was acquired by the Oracle Corporation in 2010. Oracle has now the steermanship for Java. In 2006 Sun started to make Java available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Oracle continues this project called OpenJDK.</p>

    <header class="main-header">Properties</header>
     <p>The Java language was designed with the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform independent: Java programs use the Java virtual machine as abstraction and do not access the operating system directly. This makes Java programs highly portable. A Java program (which is standard-compliant and follows certain rules) can run unmodified on all supported platforms, e.g., Windows or Linux.</li>
      <li>Object-orientated programming language: Except the primitive data types, all elements in Java are objects.</li>
      <li>Strongly-typed programming language: Java is strongly-typed, e.g., the types of the used variables must be pre-defined and conversion to other objects is relatively strict, e.g., must be done in most cases by the programmer.</li>
      <li>Interpreted and compiled language: Java source code is transferred into the bytecode format which does not depend on the target platform. These bytecode instructions will be interpreted by the Java Virtual machine (JVM). The JVM contains a so called Hotspot-Compiler which translates performance critical bytecode instructions into native code instructions.</li>
      <li>Automatic memory management: Java manages the memory allocation and de-allocation for creating new objects. The program does not have direct access to the memory. The so-called garbage collector automatically deletes objects to which no active pointer exists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Java is case-sensitive, e.g., variables called myValue and myvalue are treated as different variables.</p>

    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>  
    <ul>
      <li>A general understanding of computers.</li>
      <li>Good knowledge of basic mathematical concepts.</li>
      <li>Some programming experience, if you are new to programming, you might want to try one of the tutorials listed below.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="hello_world_program">
    <header class="main-header">Hello World Program</header>
    <p>It's time to write your first Java program:</p>
    <pre>
     <code>
      public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.print("Hello, World!");
        }
      }
     </code>
    </pre>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="variable">
    <header class="main-header">Variable</header>
    <p>Variables allow the Java program to store values during the runtime of the program.
      A variable can either be a: </p>
      <ul>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Primitive variable: contains the value.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px;">Reference variable: contains a reference (pointer) to the object.</li>
    </ul>
<p style="padding-top: 0px;">
Hence, if you compare two reference variables, you compare if both point to the same object. To identify if objects contain the same data, use the object1.equals(object2) method call.</p>
  </section>   
  <section class="main-section" id="method">
    <header class="main-header">Method</header>
    <p>
      A method is a block of code with parameters and a return value. It can be called on the object.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        public class MyMethodExample {
          void tester(String s) {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
          }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Methods can be declared with var-args. In this case the method declares a parameter which accepts everything from zero to many arguments (syntax: type …​ name;) A method can only have one var-args parameter and this must be the last parameter in the method.
    </p>
  </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="class">
     <header class="main-header">Class</header>
      <p>
        A class is a template that describes the data and behavior associated with an instance of that class.

A class is defined by the class keyword and must start with a capital letter. The body of a class is surrounded by { }.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          package test;

          class MyClass {

          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The data associated with a class is stored in variables ; the behavior associated to a class or object is implemented with methods.

A class is contained in a text file with the same name as the class plus the .java extension. It is also possible to define inner classes, these are classes defined within another class, in this case you do not need a separate file for this class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Note: 
        </strong>
        an <i><b>Object</b></i> is an instance of a <b><i>Class</i></b>. The <i><b>Object</b></i> is the real element which has data and can perform actions. Each <i><b>Object</b></i> is created based on the <b><i>Class</i></b> definition. The <b><i>Class</i></b> can be seen as the blueprint of an <i><b>Object</b></i>, i.e., it describes how an <i><b>Object</b></i> is created.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="package">
    <header class="main-header">Package</header>
    <p>
      Java groups classes into functional packages.

Packages are typically used to group classes into logical units. For example, all graphical views of an application might be placed in the same package called <i>com.leo.webapplication.views</i>.

It is common practice to use the reverse domain name of the company as top level package. For example, the company might own the domain, <i>leo.com</i> and in this example the Java packages of this company starts with <i>com.leo</i>.

Other main reason for the usage of packages is to avoid name collisions of classes. A name collision occurs if two programmers give the same fully qualified name to a class. The fully qualified name of a class in Java consists of the package name followed by a dot (.) and the class name.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        package com.leo.GUI;
        package com.leo.Database;
        
        public class App {
          GUI interface = new GUI();
          Database idNumbers = new Database();
          public void draw() {
            interface.render();
            idNumbers.initialize();
          }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Without packages, a programmer may create a Java class called <b>Test</b>. Another programmer may create a class with the same name. With the usage of packages you can tell the system which class to call. For example, if the first programmer puts the <b>Test</b> class into package <i>report</i> and the second programmer puts his class into package <i>xmlreader</i> you can distinguish between these classes by using the fully qualified name, e.g, <i>xmlreader.Test</i> or <i>report.Test</i>.
    </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="constructor">
    <header class="main-header">Constructor</header>
    <p>
      A class contains constructors that are invoked by the Java runtime to create objects based on the class definition.

Constructor declarations look like method declarations except that they use the name of the class and have no return type.

A class can have several constructors with different parameters.

In the following example the constructor of the class expects a parameter.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        package com.leo.base;

        public class MyClass {

           String s;
           // This below is the Constructor for the my Class.
           public MyClass(String s) {
              this.s = s;
           }
           // It takes an argument of the type String.
       }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The naming convention for creating a constructor is the following: classname (Parameter p1, ...) { }.

Every object is created based on a constructor. This constructor method is the first statement called before anything else can be done with the object.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        package com.leo.base;

        public class MyClass {

           String s;
           float num;
           
           // This Constructor takes an argument of the type String.
           
           public MyClass(String s) {
              this.s = s;
           }
            
           // This Constructor takes an argument of type float. 
           
           public MyClass(float num) {
              this.num = num;
           }
           
           // This Constructor takes two arguments of type String and float.
           
           public MyClass(String s,float num) {
              this.num = num;
              this.s = s;
           }
           
           // I can call all different Constructors.
           
           MyClass firstClass = new MyClass("A String");
           MyClass secondClass = new MyClass(2.222);
           MyClass thirdClass = new MyClass("Third",3);
        }
